Simulation about Evolution of Blood Types

This project models the evolution of blood types in a population using an Agent-Based Model (ABM) implemented in Python. It simulates inheritance, mutation, and reproduction processes based on Mendelian genetics to explore how blood type distributions evolve over time.
Features

  +Agent-Based Design: Each individual is represented as an object with attributes like genotype, phenotype, sex, and fitness.
  +Inheritance Rules: Implements Mendelian genetics for allele inheritance.
  +Evolutionary Dynamics: Simulates key processes:
        -Random reproduction based on agent fitness.
        -Mutation to introduce new blood types.
        -Death events to remove agents dynamically.
  +Scalability: Efficient population management with Python data structures.
